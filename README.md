# SingleAdapterRV
Sample to show the structure for a single ListAdapter for RecyclerView through out the app.

This adapter can be extended in case any customization is needed.

Here what we just need to do is create ContentModel, ViewHolder to bind to the layout and add an entry in Mapper to create a new itemType.
